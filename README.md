# simpleBlockchain
This is my first Blockchain project where I create a full stack functioning blockchain web app
I have coded the Blockchain Technology in Python, and used Flask framework for web deployment.
The Technology showcases a simple math problem and a low current target for mining, so as to efficiently test it locally.
